                        I love attending conferences to learn about the latest trends in
                        technology and share my own experiences with others. <br />

                        I mostly enjoy the free food and gifts they give away üòÅ<br />

                            <li>How elastic can be integrated into SIEM and other security solutions to better understand attacks and digest the most important data (i.e. process 100 alerts and the SOC will only focus on a few)</li>
                            <li>AI and Generative AI in security: ML Agents, analytics-driven investigations, and finding threats missing by others</li>
                            <li>Elastic Attack Discovery: a short summary of all the alerts, without SOC analyst needing to analyze them all</li>
                            <li>Attack Discovery which uses LLM to analyze SIEM alerts and automatically generate summary for which alerts are relevant and returns visual analytics showing the attack timeline, type of attack, who or what was affected, when, and even suggest mitigations.</li>

                        I learned a lot about how to work in a team and how to navigate difficult tasks. As a team leader, although I didn't win, my team came in second, about 3 minutes after the first team!

                        Our task was to navigate cyber attacks and find secret messages and navigate clues to get to the correct answer.
